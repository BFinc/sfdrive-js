# sfdrive-js
Link Salesforce and Google Drive with JavaScript


Initially created to play wav files (audio) stored in google drive from Salesforce.  Can be easily abstracted out to link to pictures, google docs, sheets, ext...  Reference any field in salesforce and pull up the file(s) stored in google drive with the same name in new windows.

Utilizes a well documented client library built out by google to authenticate (Oauth2.0) and interface with google drive.  Currently built out for basic Salesforce JavaScript links or buttons.  Will build out further functionality in lightning to display related files ext.
